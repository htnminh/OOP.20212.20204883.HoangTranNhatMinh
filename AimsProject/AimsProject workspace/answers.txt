Lab04
Note: The computers in room D5-305 are too slow to run Eclipse so I guess I cannot turn in for this deadline.
For backward compatibility, the Lab01, Lab02 and Lab03 folders will not be removed. However, everything in those
folders (except for answer files) is copied to AimsProject.
- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
	Java is pass by value. Even for objects, we are working with references of those objects, which are pass by value.
- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
	The method swap() creates copies of those references, so swap those copies changes nothing.
- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
	The method changeTitle() sets the new title for the referenced object. Afterwards, it tries to assign the dvd to a 
new dvd with the old title, but it does nothing since dvd is just a copy of reference.

- Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
	So far, we can see that there is no aggregation relation between classes in the project, i.e. if a class
associates with another class, it cannot exists independently of that class. In the class diagram, those associations
are denoted by an arrow at one end and and X mark near the other end.
- Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?
	Yes.
